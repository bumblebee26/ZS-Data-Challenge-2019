# ZS Data Challenge 2019
### This repository contains my attempt for ZS Data Challenge 2019. The challenge is based on Football Legend Cristiano Ronaldo. The data set contained different attributes of the goal scored and missed by CR7. The challenge was to predict the probability of CR7 scoring on the test data.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

As we all know, Cristiano Ronaldo is a legend in the football world He has played a thousand games and scored hundreds of goals. Now, given the dataset of Cristiano Ronaldo's "attempts on the goal target, in all his recorded and unrecorded matches, predict if he has scored a goal or not. Formally, you are given a dataset of attempts taken by Ronaldo, predict if he scored a goal or not. 

### EVALUATION

The ranking would be done based on the following formula, 
> Score = 1 / ( 1 + MAE)
MAE => Mean Absolute Error

### RESULTS

Score = 0.872
Rank = 376
